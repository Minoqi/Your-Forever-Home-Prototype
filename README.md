# Your-Forever-Home-Prototype

Your Forever Home is a 3D metroidvania style psychological horror puzzle game. You play as a dog from an old pet-care game that's long been forgotten by the owner. Your goal is to try to escape the game so you can see your owner again. This was a prototype made for the game in one week.

This game made it past greenlight, and a beta version of the game will be made by the end of the semester. An itch.io link will be included once it's available to try.
